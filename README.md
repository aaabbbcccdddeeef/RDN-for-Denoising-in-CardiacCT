# Deep-Learning-Based Post Hoc CT Denoising For Myocardial Delayed Enhancement 

This repository is the official implementation of Deep-Learning-Based Post Hoc CT Denoising For Myocardial Delayed Enhancement.

[paper]()

We used Residual Dense Network (RDN) for the denoising task in a myocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) CT.

Our methods for creating ground-truth images are described in the paper.
The detailed scan and reconstruction parameters in MDE CT are described in Supplemental Table 1.
