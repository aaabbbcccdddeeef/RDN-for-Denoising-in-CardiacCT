# Deep-Learning-Based Post Hoc CT Denoising For Myocardial Delayed Enhancement 

This repository is the official implementation of:  
[Deep-Learning-Based Post Hoc CT Denoising For Myocardial Delayed Enhancement](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.220189) and  
[Deep learning-based noise reduction for coronary CT angiography: using four-dimensional noise-reduction images as the ground truth](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02841851221141656).


We used Residual Dense Network (RDN) for the denoising task in a myocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) CT and coronary CT angiography.

Our methods for creating ground-truth images are described in the paper.
The detailed scan and reconstruction parameters in MDE CT are described in Supplemental Table 1.
